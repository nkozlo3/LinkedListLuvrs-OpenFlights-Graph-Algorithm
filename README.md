# LinkedListLuvrs-OpenFlights-Graph-Algorithm

## Data CSV:
 We are using the airport.dat file from https://openflights.org/data.html.
 
 ## Project Goals:
 The goals of this project are to create a graph out of the airport.dat csv file. And be able to run algorithms of interest on this graph. We will be able to determine things such as the optimal flight paths between the last 10 olympic host countries using our algorithms.
