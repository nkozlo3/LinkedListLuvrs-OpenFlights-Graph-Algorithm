# LinkedListLuvrs-OpenFlights-Graph-Algorithm
Final Project for CS 225

Team Members: Collin Fox, Nora Batko, Neil Kozlowski, Nisha Ramanathan

## Data CSV:
 We are using the airport.dat file from https://openflights.org/data.html.
 
 ## Project Goals:
 The goals of this project are to create a graph out of the airport.dat csv file. And be able to run algorithms of interest on this graph. We will be able to determine things such as the optimal flight paths between the last 10 olympic host countries using our algorithms.
 
 # Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 

    Meet twice a week. On Wednesday at 2:30 PM and Saturday at 3:00 PM. Clarify this weeks goals on X; check in on this weeks goals/collaborate on Y.
    
    Each meeting will have an assigned length of 60 minutes. Meet in person at siebel or through a discord call if unable to attend in person.
    
    Arrange optional meetings over discord to collaborate with group member(s) on goals/algorithms/etc one is having trouble achieving.

2. **Assistance** 

    Discord will be the primary method of communication! 16-24 hours maximum response time!

3. **Respect** 
    
    Post any and all ideas in the discord server "LinkedListLuvrs: CS225 project"; with a policy of at least two team members responding or contributing to the idea within 24 hours? This will encourage active listening and engagement with group members!

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

    On our first meeting of the week we will decide what our goal is, split that goal into smaller subgoals roughly equal in size and difficulty and take turns choosing subgoals. Each member will choose there own subgoal in order to tailor to our unique strengths and desires.

5. **Time Commitment** 
    
    Each team member will allocate around 3 hours per week on the project. Some weeks will be lighter with less hours spent and some will be greater with more hours spent. Each team member will spend time on the project working around their prior and future commitments. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

    In the event that we come to a disagreement, whether one of us feels that someone is not holding up their end, we will have an additional meeting with our team to address this issue. The goal is to have this conversation early so that each member does not feel overwhelmed. If we learn that someone is taking on more than they can handle, it's important for us to learn this early. We are all adults and will be able to handle disagreements accordingly. If a problem persists we will differ to our mentor and or some third party.
